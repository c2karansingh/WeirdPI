# WeirdPI (go to this URL https://c2karansingh.github.io/WeirdPI/ to see it in action!)
A Unity implementation of 3Blue1Brown's Pi value calculation based on collision video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsYwFizhncE
 in 3 dimensions.We have extensively repurposed the code made by CelestialAmber (https://github.com/CelestialAmber/3Blue1Brown-Block-Collision-Problem-Unity). Note that we have not used Physics Engine over here because it makes it very heavy and makes the simmulation very hanging
